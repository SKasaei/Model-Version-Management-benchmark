Welcome to the official repository for **BenchmarV**, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model versioning systems. This repository accompanies the paper:

> **"A feature model and benchmark for model version management in collaborative modeling environments"**  
> *[Author(s) Name]* â€“ [Journal of Software: Evolution and Process , 2025]

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

BenchmarV offers:
- A **feature model** and **comparison tables** covering state-of-the-art versioning approaches.
- A set of **8 representative model versioning scenarios**, designed to reflect real-world collaborative modeling needs.
- Detailed **scenario descriptions** and **model artifacts** to enable consistent benchmarking across different tools and techniques.

This repository serves both as a reference implementation and a reusable benchmark for researchers and tool developers working on model versioning and collaborative modeling systems.

## ðŸ§© Repository Structure

- **FeatureModel/**: Contains the feature model diagram, its XMI representation, and comparison tables of existing tools.
- **Models/**: Includes eight folders, each representing a model versioning scenario with relevant model files. The history of versioning changes are recorded in this part.
- **Scenarios/**: Includes the documentation of model versioning scenarios.

## ðŸ“˜ Usage

You can use the artifacts in this repository to:
- Evaluate your model versioning approach/tool.
- Reproduce the benchmark scenarios in your modeling environment.
- Compare versioning capabilities.

> Note: Artifacts are provided in standard formats (e.g., XMI and ECORE) for interoperability. If your tool uses a different format, you may adapt the models while preserving their structure and semantics.
