Welcome to the official repository for **BenchmarV**, a benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model versioning systems. This repository accompanies the paper:

> **"A feature model and benchmark for model version management in collaborative modeling environments"**  
> *[Mohammad-Sajad Kasaei]* *[Afsaneh Fatemi]* *[Mohammadreza Sharbaf]* *[Bahman Zamani]* *[Dominique Blouin]* â€“ [Conference/Journal Name, Year]

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

BenchmarV offers:
- A **feature model** and **comparison tables** covering state-of-the-art versioning approaches.
- A set of **8 representative model versioning scenarios**, designed to reflect real-world collaborative modeling needs.
- Detailed **scenario descriptions** and **model artifacts** to enable consistent benchmarking across different tools and techniques.

This repository serves both as a reference implementation and a reusable benchmark for researchers and tool developers working on model versioning and collaborative modeling systems.
